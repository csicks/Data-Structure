# DataStructure
Implemention of some simple data structures.

Including: Liner, Circle liner, Queue, Stack and Polynomial.

Some algorithms about these data structure may be included, either.

Most of the comments are in Chinese.

You may need to add "Console.ReadLine();" at the end of the main function to keep the command window open after the program finishes so that you can better check the results. 

Finished in 2017.
